The world of technology is experiencing many developments that are increasingly sophisticated.
In its application, this technological development can be applied in everyday life.
As is the case with facial recognition systems. 
This facial recognition system uses the face as the main object of research in this technology, 
which on the face will be detected and can find some information in individuals such as age and gender predictions.

Therefore, this time I want to share what I got from this lesson. 
This program was created with my team shafa and marni where the program can detect age and gender using facial images.
